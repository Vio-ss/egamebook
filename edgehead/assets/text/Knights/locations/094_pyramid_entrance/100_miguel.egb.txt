"Sarn? Doesn't ring the bell. Who is he?"

* "He came here to join the Knights."

    Miguel looks surprised. "He's a warrior, then?"

    * * "No, a blacksmith."

        "Ah. He's a mender with the Knights," he says. <>

* "A blacksmith."

    "There are no blacksmiths here." Miguel gestures around, towards the ruins and the forest.

    * * "Whose work is your sword, then?"

        "Her?" He looks at his sword and pats it. "She's not from here. I bought her in Lywood, years ago, for more coins that I will admit." He smiles for the first time since we met.

        * * * "The sword looks great."

            Miguel's smile widens. "You get what you pay for. And I'm taking good care of her, taking her to ..." Miguel stops. "Oh!" He shakes his head, still smiling.

        * * * "Who repairs it when there's a chink in the blade?"

Miguel looks over his shoulder at the Pyramid, then back at me. "Even if he is in there, you would not want to get in. You would want to get out."

The woman looks at him with a mix of puzzlement and exasperation, then she turns to me.

"This place is no longer safe. Orcs, goblins. Unless you have business with one of the farmers, you shouldn't go in."
