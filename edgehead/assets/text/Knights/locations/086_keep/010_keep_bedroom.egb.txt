POS: 15, 82

MAP_NAME: Lord's Quarters
HINT: Though derelict, these are still the nicest parts of the Keep.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
Redwood parquetry, the wooden flooring of the rich, creaks underfoot.

This is where the aristocracy lived: the Lord's quarters. The place has been ransacked, and is mostly covered in dust and spiderwebs. But, there is some sign of activity. Smallish footprints.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
Everything is gone. Except: a family portrait. The looters didn't touch it - superstition?
// TODO: expand on this.

COMMAND: family portrait >> examine
FOR_LOCATION: $keep_bedroom
PREREQUISITES:
w.actionHasBeenPerformed('search_bedroom')

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
The portrait depicts an aristocratic family. Handsome people.

A young, striking lady stands in the front. Kind of bored. It is clear the portrait was meant for her, as a memento for her later years. An inscription says "For our beloved Lady Hope".

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:

I take the family portrait. It's kind of unwieldy and awkward to hold, so I keep it in front of me.

NOTES:
// Vignette:
// Wooden floor in the Keep

Uneven after the years. But it does give the appearance of a castle, among the ancient flat walls. 

The sound is different, hollow.

The planks spring a little bit under my feet.

// TODO: I can look through the door and see Lady Hope. Show the picture.

Lady Hope's father is Marquis Hirayama.
