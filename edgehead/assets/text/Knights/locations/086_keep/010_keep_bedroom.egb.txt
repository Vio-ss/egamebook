POS: 15, 82

MAP_NAME: Lord's Quarters
HINT: Though derelict, these are still the nicest parts of the Keep.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
Redwood parquetry — the wooden flooring of the rich — creaks underfoot.

This is where the aristocracy lived: the Lord's Quarters. The place has been ransacked, and it is mostly covered in dust and spiderwebs. But there is some sign of activity. Smallish footprints, with scratch marks.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE

FOR_LOCATION: $keep_bedroom

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
Everything is gone. Except: a family portrait. The painting leans against the wall, in clear sight. The looters didn't touch it - superstition?

ACTION: $examine_family_portrait
COMMAND: Family portrait >> Examine
FOR_LOCATION: $keep_bedroom
PREREQUISITES:
w.actionHasBeenPerformed('search_bedroom')

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
The portrait depicts an aristocratic family. Handsome people.

A young, striking lady stands in the front. Her expression is fashionably bored. It is clear the portrait was meant for her, as a memento for her later years. An inscription reads, "For our beloved Lady Hope."

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I take the family portrait. It's kind of unwieldy and awkward to hold, so I keep it in front of me.

NOTES:
// Vignette:
// Wooden floor in the Keep

Uneven after the years. But it does give the appearance of a castle, among the ancient flat walls.

The sound is different, hollow.

The planks spring a little bit under my feet.

// Optional: I can look through the door and see Lady Hope. Show the picture. Probably not needed?

Lady Hope's father is Marquis Hirayama.
