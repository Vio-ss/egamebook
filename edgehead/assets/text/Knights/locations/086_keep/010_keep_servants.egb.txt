Next to it, a crude goblin-tongue writing says "YOU FOUND NORTH SKULL STUPID! GO UP NOW". An arrow points to [[IF c.playerHasVisited("keep_servants", from: "top_of_climb")]]the narrow passage connecting this room to the elevator shaft[[ELSE]]a corner of the room that, after closer inspection, hides a narrow crawlspace[[ENDIF]].

[[IF c.hasItem(compassId)]]As I circle the "North Skull", the compass always points directly at it.[[ENDIF]]

The north skull

A device that the compass is pointing to. It's how you can find a hidden room (if using the compass in a room right next to it).

The skull room provides quick access to higher floors. You can also get there without the compass, but only from upward.

The skull is either immovable, or placing it somewhere will make goblins go there.
