APPROACH: $keep_servants FROM $top_of_climb
DESCRIPTION:
I climb down the elevator shaft. All the exits are shut except for one almost at the very bottom of the tower. It leads to a narrow passage paneled with wood, and then into a cramped room inside the Keep.

ROOM: $keep_servants

FLAGS: $IDLE

POS: 19, 84

MAP_NAME: Servants' Quarters
HINT: The cramped rooms where the servants of the Keep's owner once lived and worked.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
Clear signs of goblin activity: scratches on the floor, a pile of bones in one of the corners, and the stench of goblin excrement. A curious skull-shaped device sits in the middle of the room.

Next to it, crude goblin-tongue writing says "YOU FOUND NORTH SKULL STUPID! GO UP NOW." An arrow points to [[IF c.playerHasVisited("keep_servants", from: "top_of_climb")]]the narrow passage connecting this room to the elevator shaft[[ELSE]]a corner of the room that, after closer inspection, hides a narrow crawl space[[ENDIF]].

[[IF c.hasItem(compassId)]]I reach into my pocket and pull out the compass. As I circle the "North Skull," the device always points directly at it.[[ENDIF]]

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I take the North Skull. As I straighten up, my heart stops. Something is moving in the corner of the room. But then I realize it was only my shadow.
