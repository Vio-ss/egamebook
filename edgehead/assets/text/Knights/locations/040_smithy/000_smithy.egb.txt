POS: 24, 40

FIRST_MAP_NAME: Sounds of an Anvil
FIRST_HINT: A regular metallic beat and a smell of coal dust and hot steel.

MAP_NAME: Smithy
HINT: The involuntary workplace of my brother Sarn under the orc rule.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
There's an iron door here that is shut and locked but [we] find a way through a high ventilation shaft. The crawlspace is tight and full of rat droppings, but at least it allows an unseen approach.

Finally, I am able to peek through a large hole in the shaft, and I look down on the room below.

My brother, Sarn, is forging a battle axe, using some piece of ancient metal equipment as a handle.

FOR_LOCATION: $smithy

IS_IMMEDIATE: $TRUE

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I drop down next to Sarn. He looks surprised, but there is no recognition in his eyes.

The orc jailer takes an iron mace and advances toward me.

"Step back, weaponsmith," he says to Sarn. "Let me deal with this worm."

The orc pushes Sarn roughly to the side, and Sarn falls headfirst into a wall, then slumps to the floor.
