The fight is over. I wheel around and turn to my brother, who is slowly coming to life after the rough fall. He looks at the dead jailer, then at me. Does he even recognize me?

* “I came for you.”

  “For me,” Sarn says. <>

* “It’s me, Aren.”

  “Aren,” he says. <>

-

<> I wait, but there’s nothing more for a long time. Anger expands in my chest with each heartbeat.

   I was looking forward to revenge. A beating, at least, but I admit I fantasized about blood as well. The pure selfishness with which Sarn left a broken [[IF c.playerIsMale]]boy[[ELSE]]girl[[ENDIF]] and a broken father instead of helping them make ends meet and find their footing again — there's only one answer to that. Violence.

But how can I do that now?

Straining, Sarn looks into my eyes. "Thank you, [[IF c.playerIsMale]]brother[[ELSE]]sister[[ENDIF]]."

I almost break down and say “You’re welcome,” but then I remember my father’s face the morning we realized that Sarn was gone.

* "Thank you? You'll have to do better than that!"

  "Well, what do you expect? <>

* "What wouldn't I do for my beloved brother?"

  Sarn searches my face, looking for evidence of snark. "I didn't ask for your help, [[IF c.playerIsMale]]boy[[ELSE]]girl[[ENDIF]]. I thanked you. Did you expect a speech? <>

-

<> Should I shower you with gifts? I don't know if you noticed, but I don't have much to give here."

* "How about an apology?"

  He purses his lips and doesn't reply. <>

* "Don't you remember the last time we saw each other?"

  He sighs and bows his head. "Of course I do."

  I don't think he does. I don't think he realizes what happened next. <>

-

<> I tell him about the freezing, sleepless nights up in Falling Rock. How I was hoping that he would show up after all. How I was sure it was all a big misunderstanding.

Because: how could anyone leave their family, I thought, at such a time? How could anyone abandon their father when he was so obviously broken? How could they desert their [[IF c.playerHasAsthma]]asthmatic[[ENDIF]][[IF c.playerHasWoodenFoot]]crippled[[ENDIF]] sibling[[IF c.playerHasBurntFace]], still recovering from the burn[[ENDIF]], too young and frail to make ends meet?

"Stop it," Sarn says. "What I did wasn't fair to you or dad, I admit. But I was as broken by mom's death as he was, only in a different way. Dad was spending nights at her grave, repeating old conversations. I spent my nights planning. Preparing."

He meets my eyes and points a finger at his head. "Dad was escaping by going into the past. I was escaping into the future." I notice his finger is shaking. Is it anger? Adrenaline? Pain?

"It wasn't fair to the family," he says. Both his hands are shaking uncontrollably now. "But I was following my passion. Didn't our mother teach us about following our passion?"

* "She didn't mention abandoning the family."

  "I knew you wouldn't understand," he says. <>

* "What's wrong with your hands?"

  "Nothing's wrong with my hands, [[IF c.playerIsMale]]brother[[ELSE]]sister[[ENDIF]]," he says. <>

-

<> He is clearly in pain now. I see it on his face. This isn't anger, it's something else. Sarn goes to his knees, gripping his head.

"I hate you," he whispers, shaking. "You come all this way only to remind me of my failure."

* "I hate you, too, brother."

  There is defeat in Sarn's face. He kneels and shakes, eyes closed.

* "Let's say I also followed my passion."

It’s true. I had been planning for this journey from the day Sarn left until the day I was old enough to follow.

  "Enough!" Sarn roars. His whole body trembles and he closes his eyes.

* "We should stop this, you're not well."

  There's a subtle nod as Sarn closes his eyes and tries to control his trembling.

-

I watch him for a few moments, then help him to his knees. We should get out of here.

INK:
I usher Sarn out of the smithy and through the places I know, downwards. Sarn is obedient but slow to react. I can’t risk combat with him in tow.

If anyone is to kill my brother, it is going to be me.

As we make our way through the orcs' territory, I keep a close watch on Sarn's face and hands. He is still trembling. His agony is only getting stronger, it seems, though he tries to conceal it. In a dark corner, I check his body for wounds, but find nothing.

A silent hour later, we arrive at the Bleeds.

I look for a place to rest, and see Jisad’s porch. The blind man is sitting on his stool, listening to the sounds of the village.

“Of course!” Jisad says after I ask for help. “Brother, you say? Bring out two chairs from my kitchen. You can sit beside me.”

[[THEN]]
I look for a place to rest. The only dwelling that could be even remotely described as inviting is a little house with a porch and a man sitting outside.

I approach him and realize that the man is blind.

“I’m Jisad,” the man tells me. “Welcome to San Francisco.”

I ask if I can rest with my brother on his porch.

“Of course!” Jisad says. “Brother, you say? Bring out two  chairs from my kitchen. You can sit beside me.”
[[ENDRULE]]
[[ENDRULESET]]

In a moment, Sarn, Jisad and I are sitting on the porch, facing the center of the Bleeds. Briny wind ruffles our hair and chills our hands.

* “Are you okay now, Sarn?”

  “Yes,” he says. But it’s a mechanical answer. He’s getting worse. <>

* “Snap out of it, brother.”

  No response, of course. <>

-

<> I realize that the scumbag is dying. Something in my brother is dying, and that makes me feel more pointless than ever before.

“The fight is not over,” Jisad says.

I turn around in surprise.

* “What do you mean?”

  “There are things larger than ourselves,” he says, straightening on the seat. “Larger than life. We can take what we want for ourselves, we can solve our own little problems.”

  Jisad touches just below his missing eyes.

  “But that doesn’t mean the fight is over. The fight is not over.”

* “What fight?”

  “You came here to accomplish something,” he says. “Everyone does. And you succeeded.”

  He turns to me, as if trying to make eye contact.

  “Congratulations.”

  * * “I achieved nothing.”

    “Your brother,” Jisad says, and stops there. There’s a pause.

  * * “Thank you.”

-

"The real fight is larger," Jisad continues. "It carries on even after we die. If you take up _that_ fight, you become immortal."
