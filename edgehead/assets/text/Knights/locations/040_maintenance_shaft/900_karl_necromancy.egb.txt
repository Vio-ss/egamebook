// Keep this in sync with RaiseDead.helpMessage.
HINT: Raising the dead will make them fight for me. I do not know in advance which corpse will rise. I cannot do this if I am already followed by an undead. My powers are not strong enough to hold two unliving minds.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I perform necromancy. I feel I have awaken something human-sized but not entirely human. Then, a terrible roar and thrashing comes from beyond the gate.

[[CODE]]
// Keep in sync with FightSituation's RaiseDead.applySuccess.
c.outputStoryline.addCustomElement(StatUpdate.sanity(c.actor.sanity, -1));
c.outputWorld.updateActorById(c.actor.id, (b) => b.sanity -= 1);

[[THEN]]

"What's going on?" the berserker asks and picks up his battle axe. "What's going on with Karl?"

TODO: They go in, and are killed. Then, some more thrashing, then silence.

[[CODE]]
  // Make sure to actually kill the two.
  w.updateActorById(orcBerserkerId, (b) => b.hitpoints = 0);
  w.updateActorById(orcCaptainId, (b) => b.hitpoints = 0);

FAILURE_BEGINNING_DESCRIPTION:
// Keep in sync with FightSituation's RaiseDead.applyFailure.
I try to perform the necromantic incantation but I fail. [[IF a.sanity < 1]]My sanity is already gone.[[ENDIF]][[IF isFollowedByUndeadActor(c, a) || isFollowedByUndeadInsect(c)]]My powers are not strong enough to hold two unliving minds, and I already have an undead follower.[[ENDIF]] Nothing happens.
