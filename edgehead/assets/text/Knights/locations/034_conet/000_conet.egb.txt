ROOM: $conet

POS: 19, 38

FIRST_MAP_NAME: Some Mechanism
FIRST_HINT: Something is making quiet chafing sounds. Reminds me of millstones.

MAP_NAME: Conet
HINT: A room filled with a large device.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
A kobold is operating a large device. He is turning a huge wheel, drawing some kind of a spring.

There is writing on the entrance:

![Illustration of a primitive writing on the wall, saying "Conet"](conet.png)

A word I do not understand. [We] stay hidden.


DESCRIPTION: $NONE

FLAGS: $FIGHT_IS_OPTIONAL

FIGHT_SITUATION:
generateConetFight

AFTER_MONSTERS_CLEARED:
The fight is over.

ROOM: $conet_after_clearing
VARIANT_OF: $conet

RULE: c.hasHappened(evConetDestroyed)

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
The room is silent.

VARIANT_UPDATE_DESCRIPTION:
Now, the room is silent.

ACTION: $conet_examine
FOR_LOCATION: $conet

COMMAND: Device >> Examine

INK:
The device occupies most of the room. It is made of massive redwood beams and concrete blocks, but also delicate machinery. The air smells of oiled wood and kobold sweat.

A large pillar of wood, concrete, and metal stands in the center. A large spring rolls around this pillar and vibrates with strange, anxious energy. [[IF c.hasHappened(evConetDestroyed)]]This spring was being drawn by the kobold's turning of the wheel.[[ELSE]]This spring is being drawn, very slowly, by the kobold's turning of the wheel.[[ENDIF]]

Only after focusing on this centerpiece do I realize that there is a subtle symmetry in the room. Rings of cracks on the floor radiate from the pillar outward, getting fainter as they recede from the core.

This is the source of the earthquakes. I am sure of it.

ACTION: $conet_attack
FOR_LOCATION: $conet

COMMAND: Kobold >> Attack

IS_IMMEDIATE: $TRUE

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
[We] step out of hiding. The kobold stops turning the wheel, briefly surprised. But then he jumps to the side and picks a big black wrench from a brown bag on the floor.

"Oh, this is going to be good," he says. "A human child."

ACTION: $conet_kobold_examine
FOR_LOCATION: $conet

PREREQUISITES:
!w.actionHasBeenPerformed('conet_attack')

COMMAND: Kobold >> Examine

INK:
The kobold is talking to himself as he's turning the wheel.

"How I wish I could be down there and fight," he says. "What I'd give to be able to crack some skulls."

He swings his free hand as if holding a weapon. "You coming at me?" he says to an imaginary foe. "You coming at me? I'm faster than you, you son of aâ€”"

Another swing of a hand, and a grin.



NOTES:
- Name inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conet_Project.
- Attracting "evil" / giants from far away.
- This is on the 32nd floor (binary symbolism).
- rejected: one of the kobolds is actually undead. He talks to me during the fight and after I kill him. It is obvious that the talking is done remotely, by some necromancer with amazing skill. The necromancer is discouraging me from getting involved.
