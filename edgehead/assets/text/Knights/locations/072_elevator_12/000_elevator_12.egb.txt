APPROACH: $elevator_12 FROM $elevator_28
DESCRIPTION: [We] climb down using an ancient rusty ladder.

// ---
ROOM: $elevator_12

FLAGS: $IDLE

POS: 32, 67

MAP_NAME: Elevator Shaft Entrance on the 12th Floor
HINT: A rare access to the ancient elevator shaft.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION: 
Darkness shrouds most of the vertical shaft, except for a single bright slit many floors above. Down here, only a narrow passage connects the elevator shaft with the corridors surrounding it.

I smell oil and metal, and everything sounds like in a cave.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE


NOTES:

- TODO: Make this hard to reach at first. The elevator shaft can also be accessed through the Floating Point. This access point is known to Oracle.
