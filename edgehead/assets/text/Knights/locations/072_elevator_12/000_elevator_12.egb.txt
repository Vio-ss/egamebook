MAP_NAME: Elevator Shaft Entrance on the 12th Floor
HINT: A rare access point to the ancient elevator shaft.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
Darkness shrouds most of the vertical shaft, except for a single bright slit many floors above. Down here on the 12th floor, only a narrow passage connects the elevator shaft with the corridors surrounding it.

I smell oil and metal, and everything sounds like the inside of a cave.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE


NOTES:

- Optional: Make this hard to reach at first. The elevator shaft can also be accessed through the Floating Point. This access point is known to Oracle.
