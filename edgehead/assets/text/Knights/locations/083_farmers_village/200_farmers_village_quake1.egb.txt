ROOM: $farmers_village_quake1

VARIANT_OF: $farmers_village

RULE: c.hasHappened(evQuake1) && !c.hasHappened(evCaravanArrived)

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
The corridors here look more like streets. Painted walls on either side, with wooden windows in them, and doors. Well-dressed people run around, trying to repair the damage of the quake, repairing doors, cleaning debris. Yet others seem to ignore all that, instead focusing on packing.

An old woman is whittling a little dog-headed figure from wood.

[[ENDCODE]]


VARIANT_UPDATE_DESCRIPTION:
The farmers look a bit more stressed. No more polite nods. Someone's repairing a damaged door, others are cleaning debris. Yet others seem to ignore all that, instead focusing on packing.
