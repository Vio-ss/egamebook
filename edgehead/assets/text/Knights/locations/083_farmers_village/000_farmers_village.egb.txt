HINT: A settlement of people who farm the vines that grow on the outside of the Pyramid.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
The corridors here look more like streets. Painted walls on either side, with wooden windows in them, and doors. Well-dressed people go about their business. Polite nods in my direction.

An old woman is whittling a little dog-headed figure from wood.
