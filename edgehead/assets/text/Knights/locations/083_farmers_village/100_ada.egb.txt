"Ah, this?" She lifts the item to her eye level and I can smell the wood. "That's Doghead, of course. People in the Pyramid believe a creature with a human body and a dog's head will come and save us in our direst moment."

* "Are there dog-headed creatures?"

    "I have never seen one. I know of hawkmen, of course, and lizardmen. I have never seen or heard of any tale of a dog-headed person, though. Except for this one." She shows me the wooden figure. "I can't know if it's true. <>

* "What religion is that?"

    "It's not a religion. Doghead is not a god. A hero, yes, but not a god. If you're asking me where the tale came from, I can't tell. <>

Ada looks around. "I think people need Doghead more today than ever before in my life."

    "The Knights are leaving. Big O at the top is growing in power. Orcs are getting bolder. There are goblins crawling all around the Pyramid. And the quakes are getting more frequent." Ada shakes her head. "This is our direst moment."

    Ada shrugs and puts her whittling knife to the figure. "People say different things. At night, we can see the lights change. Dark red and bright violet, what have you. There are sounds and screams, sometimes, and they don't seem to be coming from the Orcs. I don't know <>
