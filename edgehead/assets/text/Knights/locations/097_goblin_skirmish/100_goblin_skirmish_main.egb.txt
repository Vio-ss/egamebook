APPROACH: $goblin_skirmish_main FROM $goblin_skirmish_patrol

// ---
ROOM: $goblin_skirmish_main

POS: 7, 95

FIRST_MAP_NAME: Closer to the Smoke Stack
FIRST_HINT: Not too far to the source of the smoke now.

MAP_NAME: Goblin Camp
HINT: A shared place of rest for the goblins who travel through here.

WHERE: near the campfire

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
Suddenly, I hear voices ahead. Two goblins are arguing about something. [We] find a hiding spot behind a tree stump and lay low.


FLAGS: $FIGHT_IS_OPTIONAL

FIGHT_SITUATION:
generateGoblinCampFight

DESCRIPTION: $NONE

AFTER_MONSTERS_CLEARED:
The fight is over, and now I have time to look the camp over. It has clearly been used before: the ground is compacted near the fire, and there are old squirrel bones all over the place. (The killed goblins were about to add another set of bones to the disarray: there's a barbecued squirrel on a stick next to the fire.) 

This must be a shared place of rest for the goblins who travel through here. But on what journey?

There's a bag on the ground, and peeking out of it, a curious device.

[[THEN]]
  [We] leap from hiding and charge the goblins. The two I heard arguing sit next to a fire pit. There is another one, sleeping on the ground, close to where I start my attack. I run past him and easily kill him as he's waking up.

[[ENDRULESET]]

The goblins near the fire pit stand up. One of them, I realize, is almost naked and doesn't have a weapon near him. He grabs a branch from the fire.

The other one, the one I decide looks like the leader of the group, readies a razor-sharp, evil-looking hatchet. An ugly scar slants through his face.

"Amak, you fâ€”" he starts saying, but then I am already on him.

It's a bulky squirrel, western gray from the looks of it, thoroughly barbecued and impaled with a thin wooden stick. No one has touched it yet.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
A curious, crude device. Round as a pebble, slightly translucent, with a dark spot that moves as I rotate the device. The dark spot always points to one direction. It's like a compass. It currently points slightly upwards and toward the Pyramid.
