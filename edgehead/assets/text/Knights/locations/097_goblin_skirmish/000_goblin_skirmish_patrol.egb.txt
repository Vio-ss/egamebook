APPROACH: $goblin_skirmish_patrol FROM $goblin_skirmish_main


// ---
ROOM: $goblin_skirmish_patrol

POS: 15, 97

FIRST_MAP_NAME: Smoke
FIRST_HINT: The smoke is as black as death but the pillar is narrow. Looks like nothing more than a campfire. Someone is not afraid to be found.

MAP_NAME: Wilderness near the Bleeds
HINT: It's the place where I met the albino goblin.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
There is no path in the direction of the smoke. [We] go through the brush and step over logs and ancient rubble.

When [we] come out of a particularly nasty shrub, I hear a short, guttural sound. I look up and see a lone goblin with a gray spear. The goblin is completely white â€” even his eyebrows are unpigmented.

"You lost, peasant?"

He doesn't wait for an answer and readies a spear. The spear is painted white: as white as the albino's skin.

The goblin is starting to advance toward me.


DESCRIPTION: $NONE
