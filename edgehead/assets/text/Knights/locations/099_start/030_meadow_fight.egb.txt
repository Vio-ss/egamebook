My hands are shaking and I put them on the sides of my neck to stop the shudder. As a necromancer, I am used to death. The long, unmoving part of it, mostly.

But this, this was something different entirely. Fast. Violent. Messy. This was the savage face of death that I have not seen before. My hands are still shaking.

// TODO: let Tamara hang around (camp?), or even follow Aren to The Bleeds. Move the content below to separate actions.

The fight is over.

  I remember my brother. The reason I came all this way. I lift my head to look at the white building, my destination, showing through the redwoods to the north.

  Tamara understands. [[IF c.isHurt(tamaraId)]]She slowly stands up, and shrugs.[[ENDIF]] "I will leave you to it, then. We are quits now." In a few moments, she disappears among the trees and the bushes to the south.

  "Sorry, Tamara." I kneel next to her and put her in the position of a proper warrior death, with back to the ground and arms crossed over the body.

  No time to be sentimental. Despite the death and the danger, I remember my brother. The reason I came all this way. I lift my head to look at the white building, my destination, showing through the redwoods to the north.

  I look into Tamara's undead eyes.

  "I'm sorry."

  She doesn't respond, so I nod, and tell her corpse to follow me. No time to be sentimental. Despite the death and the danger, I remember my brother. The reason I came all this way. I lift my head to look at the white building, my destination, showing through the redwoods to the north.
