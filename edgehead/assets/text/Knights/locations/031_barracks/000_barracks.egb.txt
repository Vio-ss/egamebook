  As I duck to walk beneath a snuffed torch on the wall, I have to stop. My lungs suddenly feel as if on fire. I have a strong urge to cough. My asthma.

  There are orcs nearby that would surely hear me. I hold my breath and curl beneath the torch. Pain. Suffocation. Fear.

  After ten long heartbeats, I am able to swallow and the urge subsides. I wait a few more moments before breathing again. After that, I quickly scuttle to a more remote area, where I find a barbecued bat on a stool out of sight.

  I almost cry with happiness.

NOTES:

* What could we do here?
  * See some vile creatures play a game, with the option to attack? Orc playing cards with some goblins, and cheating (the goblins obviously know this, but don't say anything)
  * Someone big (Ettin?) eating a human leg
