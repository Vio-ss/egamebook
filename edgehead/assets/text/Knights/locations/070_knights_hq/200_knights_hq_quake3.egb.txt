FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
I come to the Knightsâ€™ Headquarters. A large room overlooking the Bay. Latrines on the right hang out of the window frames, providing fertilizer to the Slopes below. To the left, as far from the latrines as possible, the deserted bunks of the Knights of San Francisco.

There is nobody here.

Silence. The Knights have left.
