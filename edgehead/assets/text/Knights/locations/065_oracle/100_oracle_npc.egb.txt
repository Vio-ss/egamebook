“Ah, greetings to you, too, [young sir]. I am Oracle.” She takes me by the shoulder and looks me in the eye. “You are new here, you must be excited to learn about this place!”

* “Not really.”

  She keeps looking into my eyes for an uncomfortably long while. She smells of coffee. “Okay,” she says, still smiling.

  Something moves behind me. “Okay!” I wheel around and see a big dark bird perched on top of some books. “Okay!” it says again.

* “Yes.”

  “You came to the right person, then.” She steps back, leaving a feint scent of coffee behind. “Welcome.”


  Something moves behind me. “Welcome!” I wheel around and see a big dark bird perched on top of some books. “Welcome!” it says again.

-

“That’s Corax, my companion here.” Oracle nods toward the bird and the bird nods toward me.

* “It can talk?”

  “Well,” Oracle says, “all ravens can talk if you teach them. It’s a trait they’ve had since the time of the ancients. But Corax doesn’t just repeat what he hears.” 

  “No I don’t,” Corax says.

  Oracle smiles nervously. <>

* “Well met, Corax.”

  “Well met indeed, [young sir],” Corax says with a nod.

  Oracle smiles with satisfaction. <>

<> “Well, you must be bored by all this introductory talk. You’re in San Francisco! Young people don’t come to San Francisco to talk. They come here to slay.”

“Ah, the Keep!” Oracle says. “I worked there as a kid. I sometimes miss those days.”

Corax raises his head from a bowl of seed. “You told me it was horrible! You told me the nobility treated you as garbage.”

“That they did,” she says. “There was a lot of screaming, and quite a few beatings as well. I don’t miss _that._ I do miss being younger, though. And having access to all those books seemed magical at the time.”

* “What was the Keep for?”

  “It was the seat of power,” Oracle says. “Back in those days, San Francisco wasn’t as lawless as it is today. There were no orcs, no goblins, nothing.”

“Paradise,” the bird says, and its claws make a little sound on the books.

“Well,” Oracle says, “not quite. Anyway, the lords have been living in the Keep with their families for generations. By having their home in the Pyramid itself, they were close to the farmers: the ones who sent the most coin to their coffers. And of course, living in the highest tower in the world brings a measure of pride and stature.”

Corax nods and straightens, showing his black breast.

“But of course, such pride cannot last forever. Now, they’re all dead. Even the one that still keeps watch over the place is dead. <>

* “What’s in the Keep now?”

  “Death,” says Corax.

Oracle describes a convoluted series of steps to open the gate, which she calls an "algorithm." It involves pushing seemingly decorative parts of the gate in a precise order. 

"At the very end, make sure you turn the crest _eight_ times," she says. "Not seven, not nine. _Eight._ Like the Eight Gods. Don't forget, [young sir]."

Oracle sees the device and immediately starts giggling with joy. "Well that is just incredible," she says. "Such an exquisite piece."

She takes the skull gingerly in her hands and starts turning it around, examining it from all sides. "I will need to de-activate it, of course," she says.

There is a rustle of feathers and Corax lands on Oracle's shoulder. He moves his head to point his right eye at the device. "What, you don't want to _invite_ the goblins here?"

"Did you know, Corax," she says, "that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, right?"

The bird takes off again, and lands on a table. "That is _fascinating,"_ he says.

Oracle smiles and nods at me. "Thank you, [young sir]. You have provided me with a rare opportunity to study the enemy."

* "What enemy?"

  She points above. "Big O. I am doubtful the goblins or the orcs are clever enough to build a device like this. This is not ancient technology, but it is certainly _some_ technology. Or magic. Or both."

* "How will you study it?"

  "How do you study anything," she says. "You take it apart."

* "Is it that rare?"

  "I have certainly never seen anything like this. The device seems to weld _some_ kind of technology with _some_ kind of magic. Combining two fields like that: such things are always powerful."

She glances out the window, at the gray and the green. "The Pyramid was never an easy place," she says. "Never very inviting. Even before the Orcs came, death and violence was common.

Oracle extends her arm, as if to touch the forest below us. "The woods have been always crawling with vile creatures. The power of the Pyramid has always attracted the corrupt and the wicked. I think the villagers and the farmers clinged to this tale. It gives them hope."

She turns to me. "Now, with the Orcs and Big O and goblins, the demand for such a tale is only getting stronger. That little rhyme about _a_ _head_ _of_ _a_ _dog,_ _a_ _body_ _of_ _man,_ it's on everyone's mind."
