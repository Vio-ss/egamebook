throw StateError("Player should have been to the Bleeds already.");

VARIANT_UPDATE_DESCRIPTION:
The road that leads from the Pyramid entrance into the forest of San Francisco, passing through the Bleeds, is full of wagons, bulls, and new people. A caravan has arrived. They're clearly not stopping for long. The bulls are still in their harnesses, the people are not sitting down, and there is nobody setting up tents.

There is some commotion around the trader's shop, not surprisingly. People are moving goods through the back.
