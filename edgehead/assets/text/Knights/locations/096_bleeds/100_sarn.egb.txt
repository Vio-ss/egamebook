ACTION: $sarn_talk_in_bleeds
COMMAND: Sarn >> Talk >> "What happened up there?"
FOR_LOCATION: $bleeds_main

PREREQUISITES:
c.hasHappened(evSavedSarn)

INK:
Sarn doesn't answer. He rocks back and forth and doesn't even look up.

* "Do you hear me?"

Sarn nods, almost imperceptibly. But the rocking continues, and <>

* "What happened to you?"

Sarn continues rocking, and <>

-

<> he keeps staring into distance.

Did I travel all this way, did I go through all this, for nothing? [[IF c.playerHasWoodenFoot]]My left foot starts to itch. The foot that isn't there anymore.[[ENDIF]][[IF c.playerHasAsthma]]I feel my lungs constrict. I fight off the urge to cough, and I remember the cold, cold nights after my brother left.[[ENDIF]][[IF c.playerHasBurntFace]]My right hand touches the burnt side of my face.[[ENDIF]]

I have to finish this. My brother left to seek his adventure, leaving my father and me in poverty and misery. I don't owe him anything. But the people living here, under the tyranny of whoever it is at the top, deserve my help.

I will show my brother what it is to be a decent human being.

ACTION: $sarn_read_letter
COMMAND: Inventory >> Letter from my father >> Read to Sarn
FOR_LOCATION: $bleeds_main

PREREQUISITES:
c.hasHappened(evSavedSarn)
&&
c.hasItem(letterFromFatherId)

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I hope father's handwriting and his talk of "dull mountains" might bring Sarn's mind back from wherever it is.

He listens intently. There seems to be a little bit of recognition in his face. By the time I finish reading, he looks happier.

But, moments later, his face wipes again, and he continues rocking back and forth.


NOTES:

- Optional: a choice to leave with Sarn, ending the game early

There could be a Sarn >> Kill option if we wanted to be a lot darker. That would end the game? If not, then we'd have to tread carefully, especially around the ending. If we do end the game with killing Sarn, then the "Win" screen must reflect that it's just one of the choices.
