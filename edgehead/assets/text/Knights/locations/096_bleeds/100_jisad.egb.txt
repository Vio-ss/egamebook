// Jisad - Blind Guide NPC
//
// What does he want that clashes with Aren at the start? He wants the Tome of Necromancy to stay hidden, he wants to destroy it.
// He wants his old Pyramid back, the way it was in a brittle equilibrium.
// He hates violence and necromancy.
// "I will do anything to make this place peaceful again. Just don't ask me to touch magic. Much less _black_ magic."
// In the end, of course, he will need to do just that.

// Also sells hints (useful info about the pyramid). His first hint (for free) is turn around and never go back. This is too dangerous. Look around, maybe visit the Oracle down in Redwood Shores, but try to stay away from this area. His catch phrase: "Oh, you're still here!"

* "The blind guide?"

  "I know a lot about this place, and because I am — you know — blind, everyone around here calls me the blind guide." He smiles and leans over, lowering his voice. "I think they find it funny."

  * * "Hilarious."

    He nods. "[[IF c.playerHasWoodenFoot]]I'm guessing you've heard your share of jokes like that, and worse, judging from the sound one of your feet makes. [[ENDIF]]And your name?"

  * * "I'm sorry."

    He shrugs. "I don't mind it. At least they acknowledge I'm useful. I wouldn't trade nicknames with {Flatfoot Herman|Ham Fist Felix} over there, for example." He nods in the general direction of the center of the village and laughs. "What's your name?"

  * * "Aren."

[[IF c.playerHasAsthma]]I have a bout of coughing but soon get it under control.[[ENDIF]][[IF c.playerHasBurntFace]]It is so nice to talk to someone who does not see my face.[[ENDIF]]

"Welcome to San Francisco, Aren." Jisad spreads his arms and pretends to look around with his unseeing eyes. "Beautiful, no?" He grins. I take in the ruins, overgrown with redwood trees, and the shacks of the Bleeds nestled among them.

"You just arrived. Must be tired. I'll give you this." He pulls up a green apple. "It's a Fruit grown on the Slopes of the Pyramid."

* "Looks like an ordinary apple."

  He laughs. "And it isn't! Much more invigorating than a normal fruit, you'll find."

* "Thank you."

  "You are welcome."

-

I take the apple.

"Oh!" Jisad slaps his knee. "Everything! I was born and raised in these ancient ruins. It was always a little bit crazy here but never like this. The Knights are leaving. The orcs at the upper floors are getting bolder every day. There are bands of goblins closing in on this place."

* "Why is all this happening?"

  "Because magic is power, and power corrupts. This place is _infused_ with magic. And the world has noticed."

  The man turns his unseeing face almost precisely at me. "Go away. Leave this place. Forgo the magic and keep your life."

* "Why are you staying here?"

  The blind man sighs. "Where would I go?" he says. "What would I do? No. However bad this place gets, I'll stay. The Pyramid gave me everything I have — good or bad. I will see this love-hate relationship to the bitter end."

  "They're goblins. They want to raid. They want steel and slaves." He thinks for a while. "But it's strange. They come in larger numbers than you would think makes sense. They'd get more slaves and more steel elsewhere."

  * * "They want into the Pyramid, perhaps?"

    "Nonsense. Goblins fear these kinds of things. Even if they didn't, they'd probably get slaughtered by the orcs. Oh, that's something I'd like to see." He absentmindedly touches his face just under the left eye.

  * * "Do you have a theory?"

    "No. Well, I suspect there's some magic at play." He sighs.

* "I see."

-

"Anyway. The goblins _are_ getting awfully bold. I've heard a band has made their camp not far from here. So close that people can see their campfire's smoke sometimes." He shudders. "Can you see it?"

* "Yes."

  "It must be a harrowing sight. A herald of our own future, possibly."

* "No."

  "Well, that's good to know."

NOTES:

Jisad should make it clear that Aren is welcome to regain his stamina: sleep.




"So, what brings you here?"

  "Family! A commendable motivation. Better than most I have heard." Jisad purses his lips. "Well, Aren, I hope you find your brother and get out of here as soon as possible."


* "I want to learn."

  "Ahh!" The man leans back, resting against the wall of his house. "A terrible idea."

-

* "Why?""

  "There are whole religions built on the idea that there is _something_ in this building. Something that made it survive the ages. You seek magic?"

-

* "I already weild it."

* "Yes."

-

The man purses his lips. "I hate magic." He shifts on his stool and the wood creaks. "Even though I built my life on knowing this ancient place, I hate magic. For a while it seems useful, in small doses. But something happens, and everything goes to hell. Look at this place." He gestures around.
