ROOM: $pond_lizard_rock

POS: 13, 72

MAP_NAME: Lizardman's Rock
HINT: A concrete platform near the pond that serves as the lizardman's new base.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
[We] circle the pond and climb on a concrete platform that appears to be the lizardman's new base. I notice a half-eaten human leg lying on the ground here.

The lizardman watches me approach and readies his shield. He motions with his trident at my weapon.

"Fffood should not fight," he says. I remember my struggles with eating a local delicacy — the squirming sannakji octopus of Oak Land — and I must agree with the lizardman. Food should not fight. Then again, I don't consider myself food.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE

FIGHT_SITUATION:
generateLizardmanFight

AFTER_MONSTERS_CLEARED:
The monster is dead. I look around for treasure but don't see anything except for a few bones. One can be perfectly happy with a life spent eating, it seems. No treasure or purpose was needed for the lizardman.
