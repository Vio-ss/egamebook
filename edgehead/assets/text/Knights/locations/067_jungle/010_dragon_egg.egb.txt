POS: 22, 58

FIRST_MAP_NAME: Sacred Shrine
FIRST_HINT: A well-hidden place of worship near the village of the Deathless.

MAP_NAME: Sacred Shrine
HINT: The place with the Dragon Egg.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
The Deathless lead me through thick foliage and across narrow beams high above the jungle. A single misstep would mean a long fall, and certain death.

Soon, though, the hidden path takes a turn and leads into a small clearing. One of the Deathless holds a branch so it doesn't hit me, announcing: "The Sacred Shrine."

There's a pedestal here, illuminated by rays of sunlight. Only one thing lies on the top of the pedestal: a dark green oval shape. The ancient Dragon Egg.

INK:
I slowly approach the pedestal. The Dragon Egg is clearly of ancient origin: it doesn't look like anything I have ever seen. It is also spectacularly well preserved.

* "How come the egg is like new?"

    The Deathless who held the branch earlier shrugs. "We do not know, Friend of the Deathless. This place, the Pyramid, seems to have that effect."

* "How did you find this?"

    The Deathless who held the branch earlier speaks: "It was found near the pond, Friend of the Deathless. Down there in the jungle. A brother lost his life retrieving it."

-

Something shuffles behind me and the Deathless bow their heads. I turn around and see that Argo has entered the clearing.

"The Dragon Egg has been the most sacred artifact of our people since we lost access to the Lair of God," she says. "But it is also a weapon."

* "How can you know it is a weapon?"

    "Oracle told us," Argo says. "She knows these things. According to her, <>

* "What kind of weapon is it?"

    "From what we understand, <>

-

<> it is a thrown weapon. You can only ever use it once, to devastating effect."

Argo slowly circles the pedestal and stops on the other side, facing me. "I think," she says, haltingly, "that it is in the spirit of our mission to offer the Dragon Egg to you."

* "What do you mean?"

    "I mean," Argo says with sudden confidence, "that the Dragon Egg can be yours. <>

* "Why would you do that?"

    Argo smiles with sudden confidence. "It's simple. <>

-

<> You have shown strength and purpose. A holy weapon like the Dragon Egg befits you. It will aid in your fight."

She turns to the onlooking villagers. "We now have the Artifact Star, a much more peaceful symbol of the ancients. I believe it is in our tribe's interest to provide the Dragon Egg to this noble [[IF c.playerIsMale]]man[[ELSE]]woman[[ENDIF]]."

The villagers bow their heads and Argo slowly lifts the Dragon Egg from its pedestal.

"This Dragon Egg is now yours, Friend of the Deathless," she says. "Use it in combat only, and only in the direst of situations. Remember: once it is used, it will disappear forever."

I take the Dragon Egg in my hands. It is surprisingly heavy and cold. The lever and the pin at the top, I learn, are what sets the device in motion. Carefully, I place the egg in a pocket on my chest.

HINT: Argo said the egg is to be used in combat. But it's tempting to try and use it now.

REPEATABLE: $TRUE

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I take the Dragon Egg out and turn it in my hand. The shape is mesmerizing. Beautiful. A true artifact of the ancients.

Argo warned me only to use it in combat. I shake my head. No, this is too good to be thrown away at the enemy. I remove the pin, just as she told me, and release the lever. There's an audible click inside the egg as I do so.

The lever comes off, so I now hold the lever in my left hand and the egg in my right hand. The device looks more like an actual egg now, without the lever. I enjoy the symmetry.

Nothing seems to be happening. I put the egg closer to my ear in case there are any more clicks to be heard. Nothing. Not a sâ€”
