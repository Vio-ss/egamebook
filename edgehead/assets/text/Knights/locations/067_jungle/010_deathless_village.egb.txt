I approach with the Artifact Star in hand. When the villagers realize I am offering the item to them, there is a brief moment of complete silence. Then, everybody moves at once.

"I kneel before your generosity," she says. And she kneels, and the rest of the villagers immediately follow suit.

Argo smiles at me. "We have been hoping to win back the Artifact Star from the orcs for years. But we are not fighters. None of us have the talents required to stand up to the orcish host."

She opens her arms and stands up. "You do. And you chose to use your talents for good."

With ceremonial slowness, she takes the star from my hand. "You are now a friend of the Deathless. As such, you will command respect from each and every one of us." She speaks loudly, clearly. The rest of the villagers still kneel, watching me silently.

Argo the turns around to her people. "The Star will be deposited in the Sacred Shrine, next to the Dragon Egg. And I think our friend has deserved full access."

I now have access to the shrine of the Deathless, not far from here.

NOTES:

Optional: Make it harder to get here. Add at least one "twisty little passages" area in between jungle entrance and here. Or just "jungle floor", which is the place where you can meet lizard man

Optional: Village >> Observe - shows a bit more info, plus mentions a sarcofagus for a dead marine.

Optional: raising a well-preserved marine _and then putting him to rest_ should also trigger evDeathlessRespectGained / or maybe, we can't raise the well-presrved marine (too old) but instead we raise an insect, which will delight Argo.

Optional: killing the lizardman when he's in the Jungle should also trigger evDeathlessRespectGained - we should have a variant here just after lizardman is killed near the pond - for that, we need to also modify the end of the "give star to deathless action" and also "dragon_egg_room"
