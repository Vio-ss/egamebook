APPROACH: $darg_tent FROM $barracks

ROOM: $darg_tent

POS: 33, 23

FIRST_MAP_NAME: On Top of the Eastern Shaft
FIRST_HINT: There is access to the outside of the Pyramid here. The walls next to the ancient door are painted red and decorated with human teeth and other signs of orc power.

MAP_NAME: Orc Leader's Tent
HINT: A tent placed on top of the Eastern shaft, overlooking the bay.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
This is a concrete platorm sitting over six hundred feet above the redwood forest. I can clearly see the Bay from here, and the ancient bridge over it.

A richly decorated tent sits at the center of the platform. I can see dagger and sabre motives, painted in red color on the off-white tent. Some important orc must be stationed here.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE

FLAGS: $FIGHT_IS_OPTIONAL

FIGHT_SITUATION:
generateDargTentFight

AFTER_MONSTERS_CLEARED:
The fight is over. I look around, half expecting a company of orcs. But not a single one has come. They probably didn't consider it necessary to post guards around this remote place, and the wind has swept away the sound of battle.

A richly decorated tent sits at the center of the platform. I can see dagger and sabre motives, painted in red color on the off-white tent. Some important orc must be stationed here.

As I consider that, I see a large figure through the flaps of the tent. It is Darg, the leader of the orcs I first saw in the orcs' temple.

// No need to talk about Darg's weapon or appearance. If we see him here, that means we saw him in Crowdsource before.

[We] stay hidden.

VARIANT_UPDATE_DESCRIPTION:
Darg, the leader of the orcs I first saw in the orcs' temple, is here.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
[We] approach Darg's tent. Darg spots me and looks surprised at first, then amused.

"A human child, here?" Darg says, readying his battle axe. "Must have found a crawlspace to get here." He grins. "Never mind, [[IF c.playerIsMale]]boy[[ELSE]]girl[[ENDIF]]. I'll dance on your bones."
