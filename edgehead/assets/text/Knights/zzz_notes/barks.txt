# Barks

By default, barks apply for everyone except the player (i.e. when warging, we don't want the player to automatically say something).

## Orc/goblin, just after successful aggressive action, not confused, not undead

- <subject> grin<s>
- <subject> chuckle<s>
- "You seem surprised," <subject> say<s>.
 
## Player, not warging, just after getting hit
- _Ouch._
- It hurts like a mother.
 
## Leroy, Joe's son, after successfully dealing damage
- "I'm doing it!" <subject> exclam<s>.
- "Take that, s- scum." <subject> somehow manage<s> to look both triumphant and awkward.

## goblin after unsuccessful action

- subject grind<s> subject's teeth
