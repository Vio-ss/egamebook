COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I take the letter from my pocket and read it.

My young friend,

You ask good questions. But before I will answer them, we must do something with your situation.

You must understand that a necromancer cannot be poor. There is no glory for practitioners of our profession unless we wield the resources and power to lead others.

It's not my place, or style, to share my wealth with you. But I can do something more exciting.

I can share some knowledge. There exists a curious structure called the Pyramid. It lies in the ruins of an ancient city called San Francisco. The place is rich with ancient artifacts and gold.

Go there, and take all you can. Learn about the place.

If you succeed in your quest, you may have the apprenticeship you seek.
